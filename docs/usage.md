# Usage

## Installation

You can install latest release with pip:
```bash
python3 -m pip install mkdocs-placeholder-plugin
```

If you want to use the (sometimes very unstable) bleeding edge version, see the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-placeholder-plugin).

## Configuration

### Register plugin

Add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - placeholder
```

> If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you will likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set.

More information about plugins in the [MkDocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/).

### Defining placeholders

Add a `placeholder-plugin.yaml` in the root of your MkDocs project and define the placeholder names and initial values here.
For example:

```yaml
placeholders:
  NAME: John Doe
  PLUGIN: MkDocs Placeholder Plugin
  RATING: great
  YEAR: 2023
  RANDOM: 5
```

Ideally you only use capital letters and underscores in your placeholders.
Other characters may be interpreted as markdown syntax or lead to syntax highlighting splitting the placeholder.
If that happens, the placeholder replacement will fail.
Leading and trailing underscores should not be used, since they are reserved for future features.

## Using placeholders

Now you can use the placeholders you defined using the following `xPLACEHOLDER_NAMEx` format.
Example text:

```markdown
Hi, I am xNAMEx and I think that xPLUGINx is xRATINGx!
```

## Changing placeholder values

By default an table with input fields for all editable placeholders used on the page is added to the top of each page.
If the page has no placeholders, this table is hidden.
You can disable the automatic insertion of tables by disabling the `auto_placeholder_tables` option (see [configuration](./configuration.md)).

### Input table

You can manually insert placeholder tables like the ones generated by default with the following syntax:

```html
<div class="auto-input-table" data-hide-empty data-columns="description-or-name,input"></div>
```

Using a `<div>` and the `auto-input-table` class is mandatory.
If you include the `data-hide-empty` attribute, the table will be hidden if it would be empty.

The `data-columns` attribute specifies a list of columns to include in the table.
Valid column names for `data-columns` are:

- `description`: Shows the placeholder's description (if available)
- `description-or-name`: Shows the placeholders description. If none exists, the placeholders name is shown instead.
- `input`: Shows an input element, that can be used to change the placeholder's value
- `name`: Shows the placeholder's name
- `value`: Shows the placeholder's expanded value

### Input field

You can create an input field (that will change a placeholder's value) with the following syntax:

```html
<input data-input-for="PLACEHOLDER_NAME">
```

For example:

```html
<label>Your name: <input data-input-for="NAME"></label>
```

All inputs tagged this way will get assigned the class `input-for-variable`, so that you can more easily style them with CSS.
This works for the normal textbox fields and special types (checkbox, dropdown).

#### Textbox field

Unless otherwise specified, the input field will be a regular textbox that allows the user to specify arbitrary values.
So for example if you have the following in your `placeholder-plugin.yaml`, the input field will be a textbox:

```yaml
placeholders:
  LINK:
    default: https://www.example.com/test/page
```

The `default` field's value will be used as the default for the placeholder.
You can apply the new value by changing the text in the text box and pressing `Enter` (if `reload_on_change` is enabled, which it is by default).

##### Live demo

**Input element for placeholder** | <input data-input-for="LINK">
---|---
**Current placeholder value** | xLINKx

#### Checkbox field

You can also define placeholders that have only two different values.
They can be represended by a check box.

You can define them in your `placeholder-plugin.yaml` like this:
```yaml
placeholders:
  QUOTE_CHECKBOX:
    description: Use double quotes?
    default: checked
    values:
      checked: "\""
      unchecked: "'"
```

You can use the placeholder's value as you can use any other placeholder.
If the checkbox is checked, the value defined under `values.checked` is used.
Otherwise `values.unchecked` is used.
To determine, whether it is checked by default, you set `default` to `checked` or `unchecked`.
If `default` is not specified or empty, `unchecked` is used.

##### Live demo

**Input element for placeholder** | <input data-input-for="QUOTE_CHECKBOX">
---|---
**Current placeholder value** | xQUOTE_CHECKBOXx


#### Dropdown field

Dropdown fields allow the user to select one of a list of predefined options.
They are defined like this:

```yaml
placeholders:
  DROPDOWN:
    description: An test dropdown for selecting your favourite DNS lookup tool
    default: "DNS lookup with host"
    values:
      "DNS lookup with dig": "dig"
      "DNS lookup with nmap": "nmap -n --resolve-all"
      "DNS lookup with host": "host"
      "DNS lookup with nslookup": "nslookup"
```

The possible values are defined in `values`: Each key specifies the displayed option's text, while the value will be assigned to the placeholder.
You can specify the option to select by default, by passing the corresponding display name to `default`.
If this is not done, the first option will be selected by default.

##### Live demo

**Input element for placeholder** | <input data-input-for="DROPDOWN">
---|---
**Current placeholder value** | xDROPDOWNx
